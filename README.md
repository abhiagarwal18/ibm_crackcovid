## Overview

**What's the problem?**
In times of crisis, there are multiple issues which affect the community and we're trying to solve a few of them. As the number of Covid-19 cases will continue to rise, the number of people seeking treatment will overwhelm many hospitals. Having a handle on local hospitalsâ€™ capacity and resource availability could help balance the load of Covid-19 patients requiring hospitalization across a region by allowing medical staff to send a patient to a facility where they are more likely to be treated quickly. But many states lack real-time data on their current capacity to treat Covid-19 patients. 
As lockdown relaxations are taking place, people will be stepping out to go to work, purchase essentials and carry out other activities. But, normalcy has not returned and the hesitation and fear of safety will still affect people when they think about stepping out. A live monitoring of the safety status of locations around people will help manage crowd and the safety scenario in an efficient manner.
